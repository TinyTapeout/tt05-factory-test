# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

      If `sel` is high, then a counter is output on the output pins and the bidirectional pins (`data_o = counter_o = counter`).
      If `sel` is low, the bidirectional pins are mirrored to the output pins (`data_o` = `data_i`).

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Set `sel` high and observe that the counter is output on the output pins (`data_o`) and the bidirectional pins (`counter_o`).

      Set `sel` low and observe that the bidirectional pins are mirrored to the output pins (`data_o` = `data_i`).
